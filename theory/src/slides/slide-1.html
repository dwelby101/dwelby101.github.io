        What is accessibility?
      </h2>
      <p>
        "Accessibility means access. It refers to the ability for everyone, regardless of disability or special needs,
         to access, use and benefit from everything within their environment.
          It is the â€œdegree to which a product, device, service, or environment is available to as many people as possible."

      <h2>
        What does accessibility try to address?
      </h2>
      <p>
        When developing with accessibility in mind there are key areas that need to be taken into account, these include:

        </p><div class="list-wrap">
          <h3>Visual</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Blindness</li>
            <li>Low vision</li>
            <li>Colour-blindness</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Hearing</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Deafness </li>
            <li>Hard-of-hearing</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Motor</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Inability to use a mouse</li>
            <li>Slow response time</li>
            <li>Limited fine motor</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Cognitive</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Learning disabilities</li>
            <li>Distractibility</li>
            <li>Inability to remember or focus on large amounts of information</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      <p></p>
      <br>
      <h2>
        How can we create products that cater for these areas?
      </h2>
      <p>
        The most widely recognised guidelines are those provided by WC3 and are known as <b>"Web Content Accessibility Guidelines"</b> or <b>WCAG</b>.
        WCAG are organised around four core principles (P.O.U.R.):
        </p><div class="list-wrap">
          <h3>Percievable</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Available to the senses (vision and hearing primarily) either through the browser or through assistive technologies (e.g. screen readers, screen enlargers, etc.)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Operable</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Users can interact with all controls and interactive elements using either the mouse, keyboard, or an assistive device.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Understandable</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Content is clear and limits confusion and ambiguity.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Robust</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A wide range of technologies (including old and new user agents and assistive technologies) can access the content.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>
          Note: WCAG is only a guideline and should be used inline with real user testing and good user experience.
